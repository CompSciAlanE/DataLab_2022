```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

#### This is a subtitle
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Two hash tags == Title
# Three hash tags == Subtitle
# Four hash tags == Smaller Title 
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Conclusion
 
 In conclusion, don't smoke _cigs_ or drink beers. And by the way, here's some cool code:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
pi*2+5-13/100
number_of_interns<- 20
```

THe number of inters in the program is `r number_of_interns`. Isn't that cool?
