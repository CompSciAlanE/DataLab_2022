# **Introduction**

This is a data set called `pms` that comes from Mozambique, where we see whether patients have
malaria or not. With this information we also have a time stamp of when this happened, age, 
gender etc.

#### **Preview of data**
```{r}
kable(head(pms))
```

We will be going through the data and figure out which *age* has the most amount of people
with malaria and what gender they are.

## **Methods**

I will be using Rstudio and a couple of packages to organize the data in a form to plot and show
the findings.

### **Plot 1**

```{r}

train<-pms %>% group_by(age,gender) %>% 
  filter(malaria_diagnosis == 'Malaria') %>%
  tally(name = 'Count')

ggplot(data = train, aes( x = reorder(age,+Count), y = Count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col( position = 'dodge' ) +
  xlab('Age Groups') +
  labs( title = 'Count of people with Malaria by age group',
          subtitle = 'June 09 2022',
          caption = 'DataLab 2022')

```

## **Results**

The group of people with the largest count of malaria is *girls between ages of 0-<5*.
