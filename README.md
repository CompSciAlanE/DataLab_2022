Data Lab 2022

This is my repository for the amazing Data Lab intership I was able to 
participate in. This intership is about using data science for good!

This being said, the beginning of it is mainly a rStudio bootcamp which
slowly will work towards our group projects.

I will be working on the Syndemic project and help persuade the
Tennessee government with data why we should promote and fund the 
syringe exchange program.

I am excited to complete this intership and comeplete my first project
in the data science field!
